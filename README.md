Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle
Created by Peter Norvig

In this essay I tackle the problem of solving every Sudoku puzzle. It turns out to be quite easy (about one page of code for the main idea and two pages for embellishments) using two ideas: constraint propagation and search.

constraint propagation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction

search Algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithmThis is a simple Sudoku program to calculate game cells.
